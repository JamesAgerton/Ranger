 A monster catcher using lassos. Not a catch em all game, I think.
 
 Planned features:
 Navigation:
 You get a map and a compass, good luck bud cause there ain't no gps. Get lost, have fun.
 
 Catching:
 Here's a lasso, go catch some varmints.
 
 Encyclopedia:
 You'll get a camera and an encyclopedia to record your findings. So even if you can't lasso it, you can take a picture!

 Combat:
 You will command your partner(s) around a battlefield, where positioning will be just as important as the effect of your attacks!
